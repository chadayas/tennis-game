# Tennis Game
Is it is called tennis? Im not too sure, but this is a simple game created
with raylib, in which you play tennis aganist the computer.

# Running the game
I'm not knowledgable on cmake or make yet so we run with the `lraylib` flags.
```
g++ game.cpp -o ex -lraylib
```
This is a work in progress so scores and helpful text will be added on a 
ongoing basis.
